# How to upgrade from ``V1`` & ``V2`` -> ``V3+``
Upgrading older versions of the template is rather easy if you are comfortable working with the filesystem and zip files, 
Essentially we are just going to replace the old Mona folders and assets with a copy of the latest version.

## ⚠️ Important!
Before starting to upgrade the template,

**⚠️ make sure that you have not placed any of your spaces assets inside of the Mona only folders ⚠️**
