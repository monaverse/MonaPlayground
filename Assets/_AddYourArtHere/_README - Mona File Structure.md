# Folder Structure in MoNA

----------------
Hierarchy Window
----------------
The Hierarchy window NEEDS to have :
- a Space Scene with a Space gameobject under that with the Space tag
- a Portals Scene with a Portals gameobject under that with the PortalsLayer tag
- an Artifacts scene with a Artifacts gameobject under that with the ArtifactsLayer tag
- A SpawnPoint prefab with the SpawnPont tag (without it the player will spawn at 0,0,0)

DO NOT DELETE ANY OF THESE ITEMS.

--------------
Project Window
--------------
You can use any folder structure that works for you in the Project window. These Project Folders are just an example.
